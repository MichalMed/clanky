  abstract = {Over the last five to six years, ontology has received increased attention within the information systems field. Ontology provides a basis for evaluating, analyzing, and engineering business analysis methods. It is that type of theology that has allowed many organizations utilizing ontology to become more competitive within todayâ€™s global environment. Business Systems Analysis with Ontologies examines, thoroughly, the area of ontologies. All aspects of ontologies are covered; analysis, evaluation, and engineering of business systems analysis methods. Readers are shown the world of ontologies through a number of research methods. For example, survey methodologies, case studies, experimental methodologies, analytical modeling, and field studies are all used within this book to help the reader understand the usefulness of ontologies. For nearly a decade the IS community has published vast amounts of publications about ontologies in the area of Business Systems Analysis. This book acts as a comprehensive summation of this increasingly popular research area.},

             title = {Ontological foundations for structural conceptual models},
          abstract = {The main objective of this thesis is to contribute to the theory of Conceptual Modeling by proposing ontological foundations for structural conceptual models.
Conceptual Modeling is a discipline of great importance to several areas in Computer Science. Its main objective is concerned with identifying, analyzing and describing the essential concepts and constraints of a universe of discourse, with the help of a (diagrammatic) modeling language that is based on a set of basic modeling concepts
(forming a metamodel).
In this thesis, we show how conceptual modeling languages can be evaluated and (re)designed with the purpose of improving their ontological adequacy. In simple terms, ontological adequacy is a measure of how close the models produced using a modeling language are to the situations in the reality they are supposed to represent. The thesis starts by proposing a systematic evaluation method for comparing a metamodel of the concepts underlying a language to a reference ontology of the corresponding domain in reality.
The focus of this thesis is on general conceptual modeling languages (as opposed to domain specific ones). Hence, the proposed reference ontology is a foundational (or upper-level) ontology. Moreover, since, it focuses on structural modeling aspects (as opposed to dynamic ones), this foundational ontology is an ontology of objects, their properties and relations, their parts, the roles they play, and the types they instantiate.
The proposed ontology was developed by adapting and extending a number of theories coming, primarily, from formal ontology in philosophy, but also from cognitive science and linguistics. Once developed, every subtheory of the ontology is used in the creation of methodological tools (e.g., modeling profiles, guidelines and design patterns). The expressiveness and relevance of these tools are shown throughout the thesis to solve some classical and recurrent conceptual modeling problems.
Finally, the thesis demonstrates the applicability and usefulness of both the method and the proposed ontology by analyzing and extending a fragment of the Unified Modeling Language (UML) which deals with the construction of structural conceptual models.},

We discuss the paradigm shift from a transfer view to a modeling view and describe two approaches which considerably shaped research in Knowledge Engineering: Role-limiting Methods and Generic Tasks. To illustrate various concepts and methods which evolved in the last years we describe three modeling frameworks: CommonKADS, MIKE, and PROTĂâ€°GĂâ€°-II. This description is supplemented by discussing some important methodological developments in more detail: specification languages for knowledge-based systems, problem-solving methods, and ontologies. We conclude with outlining the relationship of Knowledge Engineering to Software Engineering, Information Integration and Knowledge Management.},

Their framework translates RDF(S) into conceptual graphs and then queries the knowledge base to find corresponding graph patterns. They point out several issues when translating RDF(S) into CG. First RDF resources may have more types / RDF roles may have more domains--> most general specialization of corresponding concept types is computed and assigned as a concept type to the resource / property domain in CG. RDF n-ary relations are decomposed (reified) to binary relations (CG). In addition they introduces some RDF meta-properties for two purposes : 1. to capture properties of properties ( i.e. transitive, symetric, reflexive, inverse ), 2. to model inference rules (i.e. if, then). Last enhancement of the original RDF concerns querying. Corese query language is basically RDF with additional constructs for using variables and comparison operators for data types (like >2000), concept types w.r.t. subsumption (like !<=:Airplane - not equal nor subtype of Airplane) and basic constructs for ontology query building.",

Given an initial set M of ground atoms, the P' is obtained from P by deleting all rules that have negative literal of M in the body and by deleting all negative literals of remaining rules. P'is a positive logic program, therefore, it has a unique least Herbrand model. If this model coincides with the original set M, the set M is called a stable model of P. Prolog shall conform to the SMS. Stable models for stratified programs are unique and equal to the iterated fixpoint models.

Conforming to fuzzy logic, they assume standard negation, (min, product and Lukasiewicz) conjunction and the same disjunctions. The S-implication approach is used. Each terminology axiom has a form of <(subsetOf C D), a><fc, fd, fp>, where 'a' is the certainty that the axiom holds, fc,fd are choosen conjunction and disjunction and fp is implication. Rather simple examples of classical, fuzzy, probabilistic and possibilistic knowledge bases are shown.",

Inverse roles have been ommited due to undecidability of either (inverse roles and nominals) or (inverse roles and concrete datatypes) combinations. The introduced algorithm is a common tableau algorithm augmented with some new rules for nominals and datatypes. To preventing the algorithm from infinite loops for cyclic terminologies, blocking is sufficient due to loss of inverse roles. To find a clash the only condition is needed for the datatype component - to be able to decide emptiness of some concrete domains intersection.

Furthermore standard names assumption (SNA) is considered - Herbrandt universum. The usual FO semantics is extended in a non-monotonic manner - the notion of stable model semantics (see gl1988smslp) is used. The reasoning algorithm tries to find a partition (GP,GN) of all ground atoms of given rules, such that both the terminology is satisified and a stable model for it exist.

While {SPARQL} and its extensions are being used as an {OWL} query language in many applications, their understanding of {OWL}'s semantics is at best incomplete. There is a pressing need for a concise, readable, and semantically robust query language for {OWL}. We describe a query language called {SQWRL} that we believe provides such a language. {SQWRL} is based on the {SWRL} rule language and uses {SWRL}'s strong semantic foundation as its formal underpinning. The resulting language provides a small but powerful array of operators that allows users to construct queries on {OWL} ontologies. {SQWRL} also contains novel set operators that can be used to perform closure operations to allow limited forms of negation as failure, counting, and aggregation.",

	abstract = "In many data-centric semantic web applications, it is desirable to use OWL to encode the Integrity Constraints (IC) that must be satisfied by instance data. However, challenges arise due to the Open World Assumption (OWA) and the lack of a Unique Name Assumption (UNA) in OWLâ€™s standard semantics. In particular, conditions that trigger constraint violations in systems using the ClosedWorld Assumption (CWA), will generate new inferences in standard OWL-based reasoning applications. In this paper, we present an alternative IC semantics for OWL that allows applications to work with the CWA and the weak UNA. Ontology modelers can choose which OWL axioms to be interpreted with our IC semantics. Thus application developers are able to combine open world reasoning with closed world constraint validation in a flexible way. We also show that IC validation can be reduced to query answering under certain conditions. Finally, we describe our prototype implementation based on the OWL reasoner Pellet.",

It implements several extensions to {OWL-DL} including a combination formalism for {OWL-DL} ontologies, a non-monotonic operator, and preliminary support for {OWL/Rule} hybrid reasoning.
